# Drawio_To_PNG
Drawio converter to PNG. Used to transform all page of a drawio file to transparent upscaled cropped version.
Files name will be the same of the original file plus "name-of-the-page". Do not use invalid char while naming your page or it will not work!


This project was a fun little exercise to get familiar with the Python development enviroment.
